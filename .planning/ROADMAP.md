# Roadmap: Git Metrics Detector

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 MVP** — Core analysis pipeline + dashboard generation (shipped)
- 🚧 **v2.0 Enhanced Intelligence** — Phases 1-4 (in progress)

## Overview

V1.0 delivered the core pipeline: paste a GitHub URL → LLM analyzes → mock data generates → Metabase dashboard published. V2.0 focuses on making insights deeper, the pipeline more robust, data more realistic, and enabling multi-repo comparison.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

- [ ] **Phase 1: Enhanced Metric Insights** — Deep explanations and business context for each metric
- [ ] **Phase 2: Pipeline Robustness** — Bullet-proof LLM parsing, retries, and error recovery
- [ ] **Phase 3: Data Quality & Export** — Better mock data patterns and data export capabilities
- [ ] **Phase 4: Multi-Repo Intelligence** — Cross-repository comparison and portfolio dashboards

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Enhanced Metric Insights
**Goal**: Users get detailed, actionable explanations for every discovered metric
**Depends on**: Nothing (builds on existing v1 infrastructure)
**Requirements**: INSI-01, INSI-02, INSI-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Clicking a metric shows a detailed business explanation generated by the LLM
  2. Analysis stage logs show LLM reasoning steps, not just "processing..."
  3. Each metric has a categorization with business impact score
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01: Backend insight generation API + LLM prompt engineering
- [ ] 01-02: Frontend metric detail panel with expandable insights
- [ ] 01-03: Processing transparency — show LLM reasoning in stage logs

### Phase 2: Pipeline Robustness
**Goal**: Analysis pipeline handles all LLM failure modes gracefully
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: RBST-01, RBST-02, RBST-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Malformed JSON from LLM is recovered without losing data
  2. Truncated LLM outputs are detected and re-requested
  3. Provider failures trigger retry with exponential backoff
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: Robust JSON parser with partial recovery
- [ ] 02-02: Truncation detection and automatic retry logic
- [ ] 02-03: Provider-level retry with exponential backoff

### Phase 3: Data Quality & Export
**Goal**: Mock data feels realistic with proper seasonal patterns; users can export data
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Generated mock data shows day-of-week patterns and seasonal trends
  2. User can specify custom date range for mock data generation
  3. Raw metric data can be downloaded as CSV or JSON
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01: Enhanced mock data generators with temporal patterns
- [ ] 03-02: Custom date range support in UI and backend
- [ ] 03-03: Data export API endpoints and UI download buttons

### Phase 4: Multi-Repo Intelligence
**Goal**: Users can compare metrics across repositories and see portfolio-level dashboards
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: MULT-01, MULT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can analyze multiple repos and see them side-by-side
  2. Portfolio dashboard aggregates key metrics across all analyzed repos
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01: Multi-repo data model and comparison API
- [ ] 04-02: Portfolio dashboard generation in Metabase
